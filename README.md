# Create-Your-Own-Redis
Create Your Onw Redis is part of many tracks provided by CodecraftersIO, which allows you to understand complex technologies by creating it. Because there's no better way to understand something by creating it. So in this track I will be understanding redis. 
## But, What is Redis? 
According to me, Redis is a real all-rounder. So, It is a in-memory database or data-structure store or data store or database or cache. At its core Redis is key-value (where value alreadu supports multple data stucts) and on the top of that redis has different modules for different data structures like RediSearch, RedisGraph, Redis TimeSeries, RedisJSon, Cache etc.
This is what makes Redis good contender for a primary database too. As of today, Redis popularly used a cache database on the the top of other databases. 

## Why Redis? 
There are many reasons for this I'll list some out : 
#### 1. Schemaless
 - Redis is Schemaless thus you need less knoledge of DBMS to get started with it.
 - Less complications related to database schema. 
#### 2. Faster
 - Redis is faster than other database because data in a redis server is not stored in disks. It is stored in memory(i.e. Ram). 
#### 3. No Cache
 - You don't need separate cache because Redis itself acts as a cache too. 
#### 4. Less Complicated Backend
 - For a faster web app or web site you need good databse and for that developers tend to use different databases on top of each other but this leads to complication and slower response and in turn bad backend performance. Thus using Redis as a primary database resolves all this problems with almost no performance loss.
